      <h2>üìò Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        CST 311 is an introduction to data communication technologies and computer networks. It covers
        concepts like Local and Wide Area Networks, TCP/IP protocols, routing, switching, socket programming,
        and modern networking challenges including security, peer-to-peer networks, and high-speed data
        transmission. Students use tools like Wireshark and develop Python socket applications.
