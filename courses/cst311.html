      <h2>üìò Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        CST 311 introduces data communication technologies and computer networks. Topics include
        Local and Wide Area Networks, TCP/IP protocols, routing, switching, socket programming, and
        emerging areas like wireless and multimedia networking. The course includes hands-on experience
        using tools like Wireshark, Python sockets, and network simulation with Mininet.

      <h2>üöÄ Final Project: Subnetting & Group Chat over Mininet</h2>
      <p>
        The final coursework involved configuring a virtual network using Mininet with subnet addressing,
        static routing, and communication between routers and hosts. A Python-based group chat application
        was also integrated into the simulation, demonstrating concurrent communication across the network.
        The assignment focused on practical application of IP networking, routing logic, and socket programming.
